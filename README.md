**Wallpaper Swapper**

Hello! Just made a simple python that swaps out my wallpapers at startup. I did this by using pyinstaller to make a executable, then going into windows task scheduler to schedule the .exe at startup

*I had a problem, that I have alot of wallpapers I want to use but I can only use one through windows! So I created my own application to swap wallpapers for me*
